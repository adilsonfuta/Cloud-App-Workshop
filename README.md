<a name="pre-requisites" />
## Pre-Requisites ##
- **A Microsoft account:** A Microsoft account is required to access Microsoft services such as OneDrive, Xbox Live, Hotmail, Azure, etc.  If you have an @hotmail.com or @outlook.com email address then you already have a Microsoft account.  However, you do not need to have a Microsoft email address to have a Microsoft account. 
	- [Sign up for a new Microsoft @outlook.com email address](http://signup.live.com)
	- [Associate your current email address as a Microsoft account.](http://aka.ms/easyid)  
_Note: This will not change your email hosting or affect your current account.  It will simply allow you to log into Microsoft services with an existing email address such as @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, or @yourdomain.com_

- **A Microsoft Azure subscription:** A Microsoft Azure subscription allows you to provision cloud resources.  As part of this training you will receive a Microsoft Azure Pass which is good for one month or $100 USD worth of cloud compute or storage.
